1. Download the server.c file on the host machine, and the client.c file on the client machine.
2. Run the server file by compiling it on the machine, and then running it with "./server <desired_port>"
3. That will make it so that the server machine is now listening on the desired port.
4. Run the client file by compiling it on the machine, and then running it with "./client <IP> <desired_port>"
5. The client will then attempt to connect to the desired IP and the desired port. 
6. The client will let the user know if the connection was accepted or if it failed.
